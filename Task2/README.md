# ESRGAN for Particle Physics Data Super-Resolution

This project implements an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to improve the resolution of particle physics image data. The model takes low-resolution (LR) particle collision images and generates high-resolution (HR) counterparts, enabling better analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
The ESRGAN model is based on a generator-discriminator architecture:
- **Generator:** Uses Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB) to generate high-resolution images.
- **Discriminator:** Uses relativistic average GAN loss to distinguish between real and generated images.
- **Feature Extractor:** Based on VGG19, extracts high-level features for content loss calculation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of particle physics data stored in **Parquet** format:
- **X_jets_LR** â€“ Low-resolution images `(3, 64, 64)`
- **X_jets** â€“ High-resolution images `(3, 125, 125)`
- **y** â€“ Associated label

## Model Architecture
### **Generator**
- Uses Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB).
- Upsamples input using sub-pixel convolution.
- Applies pixel shuffle for precise resizing.

### **Discriminator**
- Uses convolutional layers with increasing depth.
- Implements relativistic average GAN loss.

### **Feature Extractor**
- Uses VGG19 pretrained on ImageNet.
- Extracts high-level features for content loss calculation.

## Usage

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your dataset (in `data/`).

4. Train the model:
```bash
python esrgan.py --n_epochs 200 --batch_size 4 --lr 0.0002
```

5. Training evaluation and generated images will be saved in `images/training/`.

## Compute & Training Notes
Due to limited available compute power, the model was trained for only **5 epochs** using an **L40 GPU** from Lightning AI's free credits. As a result, the generated images are not yet perfect, and more training may lead to better convergence and improved output quality.

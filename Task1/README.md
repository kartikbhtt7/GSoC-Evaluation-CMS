# Electron/Photon Classification with ResNet-15

This directory contains a ResNet-15-based model to classify electrons and photons based on hit energy and time data from particle detectors. The model is implemented using PyTorch and is trained on 32Ã—32 matrix inputs with two channels (hit energy and time). Three experiments were conducted using different optimizers with different epoch counts, and their performance is compared.

## Task Description

### Goal:
Develop a classifier to distinguish between electrons and photons based on detector data.

### Dataset:
- **SingleElectronPt50_IMGCROPS_n249k_RHv1.hdf5** â€“ Electron dataset
- **SinglePhotonPt50_IMGCROPS_n249k_RHv1.hdf5** â€“ Photon dataset

### Input:
- 32Ã—32 matrices with 2 channels:
  - **Channel 1:** Hit energy
  - **Channel 2:** Hit time

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a modified ResNet-18 backbone (referred to as ResNet-15) with the following changes:
- **Input Layer:** Modified to accept 2 channels.
- **Spatial Resolution:** The maxpool layer is removed to retain resolution.
- **Layer Modification:** The fourth block (`layer4`) is replaced by an identity mapping.
- **Additional Block:** A new convolutional block is added after the initial convolution.
- **Output Layer:** The final fully connected layer is adjusted for binary classification (electrons vs. photons).

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model:
Run the training script with your desired experiment settings. For example:
```bash
python train.py --runname expt_50_adam --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001 --optim adam --device cuda
```

### 3. Evaluate the Model:
After training, evaluate your model. For example:
```python
import torch
from models import resnet15v2
from train import get_dataloaders, evaluate

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = resnet15v2()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('expt_50_adam/best.pth', map_location=device))
model.to(device)

# Load the data loaders
train_loader, test_loader = get_dataloaders(batch_size=32)

criterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
test_acc, test_loss = evaluate(model, criterion, test_loader, device)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%, Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')
```

## Model Comparison

The experiments were conducted with the Adam optimizer using different epoch settings. Below is a comparison of their performance:

| Model Name     | Optimizer | Epochs | Test Accuracy (%) | Test Loss |
|----------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| expt_50_adam   | Adam      | 50     | **50.40%**         | **1.01** |
| expt_20_adamw   | AdamW      | 20     | **74.70%**         | **0.50** |
| expt_20_adam   | Adam      | 20     | **75.50%**         | **0.51** |

## Results & Findings

- The **expt_20_adam** experiment (20 epochs) achieved the highest accuracy among the three experiments.
- The **expt_50_adam** seems to undergo overfitting.
- The **expt_20_adamw** holds similar performance as in case of Adam Optimizer
- Adjustments in the model architecture (such as removing the maxpool layer and modifying the backbone) significantly contributed to improved classification performance.
